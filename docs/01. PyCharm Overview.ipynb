    "# 1. PyCharm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Any code editor (or text editor, as a matter of fact) works for writing Python code. However, an IDE is a better idea, because you will have an *integrated environment* where you can write, run and debug your programs. IDEs will tipically also include integrations with other useful tools, like **git** (version control system, for keeping track of the changes in your code and working collaboratively with a team), **pip** (package manager for Python 3rd party packages), **venv** (a solution for creating isolated Python environments) and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyCharm** is a fully-featured, out of the box IDE developed specifically for Python. This means that after installing, you will be ready to dive into Python coding, without any extra configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- beginner-friendly\n",
    "- all Python-specific tools readily available (virtual environments, pip, run configurations, debugging, interactive console)\n",
    "- the Community Edition is free and is enough for most projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- it uses more memory than VSCode, which may make it slower on certain computers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "To install PyCharm, go to the [download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), scroll down to the bottom of the page to **PyCharm Community Edition** and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pycharm_installation_windows.png\" width=\"405\"/> <img src=\"images/pycharm_installation_mac.png\" width=\"400\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the installer and you're all set, you can start writing Python in the PyCharm IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a project\n",
    "\n",
    "Right after installing PyCharm, when you open it, it will prompt you with a welcome dialog with three options:\n",
    "- create a new project\n",
    "- open an existing project\n",
    "- clone a repository\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pycharm_welcome_dialog.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking _New Project_ in this dialog, as well as selecting **File | New Project** in PyCharm's menu, will open the following dialog:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pycharm_new_project.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "An essential step in the project creation is choosing the interpreter and environment type. In this step you will be choosing the base Python (you can select from all Python versions installed on your computer which one this project will use) and the tool for creating a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Library\n",
    "After installing Python on your system, you'll have access to all the functionality defined by the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). The Standard Library can be further classified in \n",
    "* built-in names (including built-in functions, constants, types, exceptions)\n",
    "* standard modules and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "All built-in names are readily available, as we've seen with the `print` built-in function above. The functions, classes and constants defined inside standard modules are available only after import (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third-party packages\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the Python Standard Library, you can install 3rd party packages. There is a vast collection of open-source 3rd party packages available in the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) built and maintained by the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Package Manager (`pip`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is the default package manager for Python and it is shipped with the language. It can be used to install/uninstall/search/inspect 3rd party packages. `pip` is a system program, so it should be used in the command-line interpreter (terminal). Some useful pip commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* install a package\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "* uninstall a package\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip uninstall <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "* install packages from a requirements file\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "* list installed packages in a human-friendly format\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "* list installed packages in requirements format\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip freeze\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isolated Python environments (`virtualenv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we need virtual environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without virtual environments, `pip` will install all site packages (third party libraries) in a single location on the machine where it runs. Global site packages are available to the Python interpreter, wherever you would call it from. \n",
    "\n",
    "But let's asume you are working on two Python projects, both of which use the same third party package `common_package`, but with different versions: *ProjectA* uses `common_package=v1.0.0` and *ProjectB* uses `common_package=v2.0.0`. This is a real problem for Python since it canâ€™t differentiate between versions in the site-packages directory. Since packages are stored according to just their name, there is no differentiation between versions. Thus, both projects, *ProjectA* and *ProjectB*, would be required to use the same version, which is unacceptable in most of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `virtualenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv` is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Some useful `virtualenv` commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "virtualenv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Activating the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unix-like systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Deactivating the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Interface. Main windows\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating / opening a project, you can see following user interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pycharm_user_interface.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Main sections of the user interface:\n",
    "1. Project directory tree\n",
    "2. Code editor\n",
    "3. Tool windows: Python Console, Terminal, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed breakdown of the user interface, see [the official documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/guided-tour-around-the-user-interface.html#main-window).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code formatting and inspections\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has little constraints about code formating except for indentation and basic syntax. The _python community_ however has a strict set of rules for code formatting which contribute greatly to its high readability. PEP8 is the de facto code style guide for Python. A high quality, easy-to-read version of PEP8 is also available at https://pep8.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conforming your Python code to PEP8 is generally a very good idea and helps make code more consistent when working on projects with other developers. It is taken into consideration to such extent that it's a condition to pass or fail an interview. PyCharm has an integrated PEP8 checker and will highlight the code and notify you with warnings when your code is not PEP8 compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there is a set of code inspections that detect and correct abnormal code in your project. The IDE can find and highlight various problems, locate dead code, find probable bugs, spelling problems, and improve the overall code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pycharm_code_inspections.png\" width=\"900\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version control integration: git in PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PyCharm provides a robust Git integration that makes version control operations seamless. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Setting Up Git in PyCharm**\n",
    "1. **Configure Git**:\n",
    "   - Go to **File > Settings > Version Control > Git**.\n",
    "   - Ensure the path to Git executable is correct (e.g., `git.exe` for Windows, or `/usr/bin/git` for Linux/macOS).\n",
    "   - Test the connection using the **Test** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enable Git Integration**:\n",
    "   - Right-click on your project in the **Project View**.\n",
    "   - Select **Enable Version Control Integration** and choose Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clone a Repository**:\n",
    "   - Go to **File > New > Project from Version Control > Git**.\n",
    "   - Paste the repository URL and choose the directory to clone into.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Git Operations**\n",
    "1. **Commit Changes**:\n",
    "   - Use **Ctrl + K** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + K** (macOS) to open the commit window.\n",
    "   - Select the files you want to commit, add a commit message, and click **Commit** or **Commit and Push**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Push and Pull**:\n",
    "   - Use **Ctrl + Shift + K** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + Shift + K** (macOS) to push changes to the remote repository.\n",
    "   - Use **Ctrl + T** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + T** (macOS) to pull changes from the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **View History**:\n",
    "   - Open **Git > Show History** or use the **Log** tab in the Version Control tool window to view commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Merging Branches**\n",
    "1. **Switch to a Branch**:\n",
    "   - Go to **Git > Branches** or use the branch icon in the lower-right corner.\n",
    "   - Select the branch you want to switch to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merge a Branch**:\n",
    "   - Go to **Git > Branches**, and select **Merge into Current** for the branch you want to merge.\n",
    "   - Resolve any conflicts (if present), then commit the merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cherry-Pick Commits**:\n",
    "   - In the Git Log, right-click on a commit and choose **Cherry-Pick** to apply specific changes to the current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Merge Conflicts**\n",
    "When merging branches, PyCharm detects conflicts and provides a UI to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Conflicts**:\n",
    "   - During a merge, PyCharm will display a notification about conflicts in the **Version Control** tool window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resolve Conflicts**:\n",
    "   - Open the **Merge Conflicts** dialog by clicking the notification or going to **Git > Resolve Conflicts**.\n",
    "   - Use the **Diff Viewer**:\n",
    "     - The **Left Pane** shows the changes from your branch.\n",
    "     - The **Right Pane** shows the changes from the other branch.\n",
    "     - The **Bottom Pane** is for the resolved version.\n",
    "   - Use **Accept Left**, **Accept Right**, or manually edit the conflicted file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Commit the Resolved Changes**:\n",
    "   - After resolving all conflicts, mark the file as resolved (right-click > Mark Resolved).\n",
    "   - Commit the merge using **Ctrl + K** or **Cmd + K**."
